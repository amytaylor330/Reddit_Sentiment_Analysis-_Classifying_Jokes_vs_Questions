I can figure out there must be an issue with the compressed air but can't explain it properly. If the object we are passing is larger like a building or smaller like a tree, noise we hear changes but the incident can still be observed. What is the best explanation of the physics here?

Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases. 

This would be more consistent with other mammals than the provider theory, so is there any actual reason the provider theory sticks around?",explainlikeimfive,1524392487.0,Yerwun,3,2,0,2

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

What I’m confused about is this: Why is it that it was mainly just the southern states that left the Union?  What was it about the southern location that gave these states a reason to separate?  I mean, didn’t the North have slaves too?

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

t3_a0gmix,ELI5: How were cheques written in the 1940's could you use someone else's cheque?,"There's a scene in MST3K 'I accuse my parents' where a character (Jimmy) isn't able to pay a bill. One of the people he's dining with suggests for him to use a cheque.Instead of pulling out a chequebook Jimmy borrows a chequebook from the other person.

Did cheques not have routing &amp; account numbers pre-written on them back in the 1940's? Did people memorize their account numbers? Was this only possible if the person loaning you a cheque had the same bank?  


I tried looking up old cheques on google images but they all seem to have the owner's name and routing number pre-printed on them, which defeats the purpose of the scene. Was it just a nonsensical scene to begin with?!

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

That being said, I figure there's probably something I'm missing here, and I don't fully get the chemistry behind creating molecular bonds, so maybe I'm just clueless.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

That being said, I figure there's probably something I'm missing here, and I don't fully get the chemistry behind creating molecular bonds, so maybe I'm just clueless.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

\*After the 6 months I start practicing again, but this time it only takes me 3 weeks instead of 4 to reach the same 8/10 skill level.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

That being said, I figure there's probably something I'm missing here, and I don't fully get the chemistry behind creating molecular bonds, so maybe I'm just clueless.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

It would also make buying tires way easier, and less stock needed for retailers/manufacturers.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

One of my hobbies is building computers. One of the big discussions in regards to this has to do with efficiency of cooling (for instance, the air pressure vs. volume schools of argument). For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

Some context: as a kid, I always was amazed by the process of electrolysis. Using electricity and something to facilitate electrical conduction (I think we used epsom salt?) to convert water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was so cool, and has tons of helpful applications. 

However, I don't completely understand why it's not just as ""simple"" to do the reverse. I understand and have seen water shortages and the damage that droughts can cause, especially to underdeveloped countries, and have always thought that more R&amp;D of this on a larger scale could, quite literally, change the world.

That being said, I figure there's probably something I'm missing here, and I don't fully get the chemistry behind creating molecular bonds, so maybe I'm just clueless.

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases.

For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

However, males are bigger and stronger in most mammal species, and that isn't the reason in any species I can think of. Mostly males are bigger because they compete with each other and due to sexual selection by females, rather than because it provides a survival purpose (other than defence from other males/groups). This would fit with our knowledge of modern hunter-gatherer and Paleolithic societies, which iirc suggests that war is the leading cause of death for young men, and women actually provide more food for children in most cases. 

This would be more consistent with other mammals than the provider theory, so is there any actual reason the provider theory sticks around?",explainlikeimfive,1524392487.0,Yerwun,3,1,0,1

For instance, [these](http://images.overclock.co.uk/product_images/large/D1225C12B4AP-15.jpg) are the fans that I use in my case for clearing pushing air out of it and for cooling off the radiator from my CPU closed-loop water cooler. 

Compared to that, I've observed that AC units will generally have just three flat paddles that seem like they would be rather inefficient for the task and the system would gain a not insignificant amount of efficiency, had it used something more appropriate for the task. 

Is this just a misconception on my part? Is this just something that is unique to the United States? Are there particular advantages (other than cost, presumably) for using fans that seem like they wouldn't be fit to push a lot of volume or air pressure?

I found an article from 2006 that mentions that some service providers recycle old phone numbers, but that was 12 years ago. Is there a finite number of available numbers, and do service providers still (unintentionally or otherwise) recycle numbers? Do they have some sort of database that shows current numbers available, and how in the world can they keep up to date with such a constantly changing factor?

\[\[Not to belabor a point, but I remember back in the early 1990s when the area code in my particular suburb was changed twice within a three-year period because of the high demand for telephone numbers - at that time, it was due to fax machines, pagers and ""car phones"" (as we called cell phones at that time).  There were dire predictions at the time that we might have to expand to an 11 or 12-digit system for telephone numbers if that demand continued. Fax machines and pagers aren't as prevalent, but certainly the abundance of cell phones has made up the difference. Yet we still use a 10-digit (not counting the '1' prefix) system.

I’m a very curious person with what my friends say is a squirrelly brain (I have ADHD and it is a term of endearment for my quirkiness). Pondering this, my next question was how is skin prepared for transplanting since it seems to be so valuable. I know skin can be transplanted to gums if they have receded or become damage too much, though usually that step is taken from the own person’s body. But that still leaves me pondering.

How is skin even prepared to go on another human being? Does it need to be sterilized since we have a lot of good and bad bacteria that accumulates on the skin? And if so, how is it sterilized without damaging the skin since we depend on moisture in the skin to keep it from being damaged.

I can’t find anything on it and hypothermia is just your body losing heat faster than it can produce it (it’s just getting cold) and heat stroke is the opposite.

And while I'm aware that No Child Left Behind is no longer on the books, I remember hearing people talk about it a lot while I was growing up, so I'm curious to know more about it.

I didn't realize until very recently that No Child Left Behind was actually an update of an earlier law called the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)

My understanding of ESEA is very rudimentary - but basically, what I've gathered is that under Title 1 of the law, schools that have a certain percentage of students from low-income families can qualify for funding from the federal government. And I'm aware that No Child Left Behind tied this funding to standardized test scores.

But unless I'm mistaken, all public schools in the country, regardless of whether or not they receive Title 1 funding, administer standardized tests and have been doing so since before the days of No Child Left Behind, right?

So my question is - did No Child Left Behind *only* impact schools that were receiving Title 1 funding? Or did it have some sort of impact on non-title 1 schools as well?

I feel Coulombs Law explains quite intuitively the attractions between ions, molecules with dipoles and even protons and electrons. 

On the most basic level I thought it's just because Hydrogen is missing a valence electron and helium has it's ""s"" pair with which it is happy. But thinking about it, why, there has to be more to it. 

So there is a Proton +1 and an Electron -1 on the Hydrogen and there is two protons +2 and two electrons on the helium -2.
Is the distance from the nucleus much farther for the hydrogen atom?  

Or does it have anything to do with the neutrons? I couldn't think of any way they may effect the ""force"" except that they may shield and act as a permeability factor.

OP's TL;DR
&gt; TL;DR: Asshole in the room beside us kept us up all night with a loud subwoofer. We very nicely asked them to stop, they didn't. So we use RF interference to blow up their subwoofer.

Now I understand this wasn't a Michael Bay movie, but I don't understand what actually did happen, or how.

Edit: Found OP's explanation (not that I understand it that well)

&gt; The distance between my antenna and their subwoofer was maybe 1ft, there was a wall in between but drywall is pretty transparent to radio waves.

&gt; The energy of a radio wave dissapates according to something called the inverse square law; in laymans terms, the energy of the radio wave drops by a magnitude of 4 every time you double your distance from the source. There are more complex things to consider (ie, radiation pattern, propagation characteristics, etc). With their subwoofer so close, it was probably experiencing most of that 400W.

&gt; Radio interference (this was essentially what I was doing) is caused by very strong RF radiation inductively coupling with the subwoofer circuitry (this generates what are called eddy currents) which results in random voltages forming at various points in the circuit which causes it to misbehave. Since I was inputting a ton of RF energy while the circuit was under heavy load (ie. subwoofer thumping), I can only speculate that it generated currents/voltages where they shouldn't be (ie. skewed the bias on the amp) and it blew.",explainlikeimfive,1545144403.0,0100110110010,2,3,0,3

I get how you could figure it out for 2 or 4 coins but beyond that it completely loses me. I don't get how it is possible to flip one coin and signify any of 64 possibilities. Can anyone explain step by step in the dumbest terms possible how this works?

&amp;#x200B;

Puzzle:

There are two prisoners, and a warden. The warden explains a way for them to go free. He has in his room an 8x8 chessboard, and 64 quarters. He proposes this challenge: He will go into his room, and randomly flip the quarters, either heads or tails, and place each quarter on one of the squares in the chessboard. Then, one of the prisoners will go into the room. The warden will point to one of the squares, which is the magic square. This prisoner then must flip over 1 of the coins on the chessboard, and then he leaves. He can't skew or move any of the coins, just flip 0 or 1. The second prisoner will then come into the room, without ever seeing the board before the change. If he can correctly point out the magic square they will both go free. What is the strategy that the first prisoner should use to make sure they both go free?

I was wondering if that was actually true, since on the 5000th try there's only a 0.367~ chance of the result not having occurred.

Edit: I definitely might be wrong, but I think my confusion isn't due to the Gambler's fallacy.

What I mean is there's a lower chance of not having gotten the result after 100 tries than after 10 tries. My question was based on looking at consecutive tries as a whole, not individually.

t3_a6u8ph,ELI5: Automotive oil weight ratings.,"This has long perplexed me and I will attempt to explain why. 


At 100F a 20 weight will flow better than a 30 weight which will flow better than a 40 weight. So, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. Now the ""W"" weights indicate the viscosity of the oil at 32F (or 0F I forget which temperature) and at 32F a 0W flows better than a 5W which flows better than a 10W. So again, like above, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. I get and understand all this but a 10W-30 flows with a 10weight viscosity at 32F and as it warms up it flows with a 30 weight viscosity. The number goes up, so the oil flows less easily but with the above stated logic and the fact that we all know if I drain 10w30 oil in a car that has sat over night in the winter verses draining it after it just got off the interstate after a 100 mile drive, the hotter and higher 30 weight oil flows better and faster out of the oil pan than the colder thinner 10W weight oil... It's this that has me confused. In my head oils should be like 50w-20 or 75w-30 because the cold oil clearly flows slower than the hot oil. The colder thicker oil flows like a 50 weight when cold and as it warms up it flows better like a 20 weight and so on....this is where my brain is hung up.

I read a story online a few years ago when someone purchased a cell phone (circa 2003) and the number she was assigned used to belong to a celebrity, so she received some calls from ""industry"" folks who had not been given the celeb's new number. I found an article from 2006 that mentions that some service providers recycle old phone numbers, but that was 12 years ago. Is there a finite number of available numbers, and do service providers still (unintentionally or otherwise) recycle numbers? Do they have some sort of database that shows current numbers available, and how in the world can they keep up to date with such a constantly changing factor?

&amp;#x200B;

\[\[Not to belabor a point, but I remember back in the early 1990s when the area code in my particular suburb was changed twice within a three-year period because of the high demand for telephone numbers - at that time, it was due to fax machines, pagers and ""car phones"" (as we called cell phones at that time).  There were dire predictions at the time that we might have to expand to an 11 or 12-digit system for telephone numbers if that demand continued. Fax machines and pagers aren't as prevalent, but certainly the abundance of cell phones has made up the difference. Yet we still use a 10-digit (not counting the '1' prefix) system.

I’m a very curious person with what my friends say is a squirrelly brain (I have ADHD and it is a term of endearment for my quirkiness).

I know skin can be transplanted to gums if they have receded or become damage too much, though usually that step is taken from the own person’s body. But that still leaves me pondering.

How is skin even prepared to go on another human being? Does it need to be sterilized since we have a lot of good and bad bacteria that accumulates on the skin? And if so, how is it sterilized without damaging the skin since we depend on moisture in the skin to keep it from being damaged.

Imagine a giant aquarium the size of a large house, sitting on a scale. Lets say the scale reads 10k tons. Now, pop in my 3 ton sailboat with the keel well clearing the bottom of the deep aquarium. 

I’d assume the scale will now read 10k tons plus my boat, so 10,003 tons. How does the weight of the boat reach the scale? I can (and have) swim under my boat and I don't feel 3 tons of weight compressing me. 

Couple of side questions: Does the water compress under that weight? Does the weight carry straight down, or spread out (imagine multiple scales in a much larger aquarium)? How are the side walls affected?

I didn't realize until very recently that No Child Left Behind was actually an update of an earlier law called the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)

My understanding of ESEA is very rudimentary - but basically, what I've gathered is that under Title 1 of the law, schools that have a certain percentage of students from low-income families can qualify for funding from the federal government. And I'm aware that No Child Left Behind tied this funding to standardized test scores.

But unless I'm mistaken, all public schools in the country, regardless of whether or not they receive Title 1 funding, administer standardized tests and have been doing so since before the days of No Child Left Behind, right?

So my question is - did No Child Left Behind *only* impact schools that were receiving Title 1 funding? Or did it have some sort of impact on non-title 1 schools as well?

I feel Coulombs Law explains quite intuitively the attractions between ions, molecules with dipoles and even protons and electrons. 

On the most basic level I thought it's just because Hydrogen is missing a valence electron and helium has it's ""s"" pair with which it is happy. But thinking about it, why, there has to be more to it. 

So there is a Proton +1 and an Electron -1 on the Hydrogen and there is two protons +2 and two electrons on the helium -2.
Is the distance from the nucleus much farther for the hydrogen atom?  

Or does it have anything to do with the neutrons? I couldn't think of any way they may effect the ""force"" except that they may shield and act as a permeability factor.

OP's TL;DR
&gt; TL;DR: Asshole in the room beside us kept us up all night with a loud subwoofer. We very nicely asked them to stop, they didn't. So we use RF interference to blow up their subwoofer.

Now I understand this wasn't a Michael Bay movie, but I don't understand what actually did happen, or how.

Edit: Found OP's explanation (not that I understand it that well)

&gt; The distance between my antenna and their subwoofer was maybe 1ft, there was a wall in between but drywall is pretty transparent to radio waves.

&gt; The energy of a radio wave dissapates according to something called the inverse square law; in laymans terms, the energy of the radio wave drops by a magnitude of 4 every time you double your distance from the source. There are more complex things to consider (ie, radiation pattern, propagation characteristics, etc). With their subwoofer so close, it was probably experiencing most of that 400W.

&gt; Radio interference (this was essentially what I was doing) is caused by very strong RF radiation inductively coupling with the subwoofer circuitry (this generates what are called eddy currents) which results in random voltages forming at various points in the circuit which causes it to misbehave. Since I was inputting a ton of RF energy while the circuit was under heavy load (ie. subwoofer thumping), I can only speculate that it generated currents/voltages where they shouldn't be (ie. skewed the bias on the amp) and it blew.",explainlikeimfive,1545144403.0,0100110110010,2,3,0,3

Can anyone explain step by step in the dumbest terms possible how this works?

&amp;#x200B;

Puzzle:

There are two prisoners, and a warden. The warden explains a way for them to go free. He has in his room an 8x8 chessboard, and 64 quarters. He proposes this challenge: He will go into his room, and randomly flip the quarters, either heads or tails, and place each quarter on one of the squares in the chessboard. Then, one of the prisoners will go into the room. The warden will point to one of the squares, which is the magic square. This prisoner then must flip over 1 of the coins on the chessboard, and then he leaves. He can't skew or move any of the coins, just flip 0 or 1. The second prisoner will then come into the room, without ever seeing the board before the change. If he can correctly point out the magic square they will both go free. What is the strategy that the first prisoner should use to make sure they both go free?

I was wondering if that was actually true, since on the 5000th try there's only a 0.367~ chance of the result not having occurred. I thought it might be 3465~ instead, since by the 3465th try there would be an approximately .5 chance of the result already having occurred. However, that .5 chance includes the result having already occurred multiple times, so now I'm stumped. Thanks in advance for the help!



Edit: I definitely might be wrong, but I think my confusion isn't due to the Gambler's fallacy. I know each individual action always has the exact same chance, but the chance of not receiving the 1/x result within Y tries decreases as Y increases. What I mean is there's a lower chance of not having gotten the result after 100 tries than after 10 tries. My question was based on looking at consecutive tries as a whole, not individually. Based on that, if the chance is 1/5000, statistically speaking how many tries would it take the achieve the result for the first time?",explainlikeimfive,1545046748.0,allcatsarebeautiful-,25,17,0,17

t3_a6u8ph,ELI5: Automotive oil weight ratings.,"This has long perplexed me and I will attempt to explain why. 


At 100F a 20 weight will flow better than a 30 weight which will flow better than a 40 weight. So, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. Now the ""W"" weights indicate the viscosity of the oil at 32F (or 0F I forget which temperature) and at 32F a 0W flows better than a 5W which flows better than a 10W. So again, like above, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. I get and understand all this but a 10W-30 flows with a 10weight viscosity at 32F and as it warms up it flows with a 30 weight viscosity. The number goes up, so the oil flows less easily but with the above stated logic and the fact that we all know if I drain 10w30 oil in a car that has sat over night in the winter verses draining it after it just got off the interstate after a 100 mile drive, the hotter and higher 30 weight oil flows better and faster out of the oil pan than the colder thinner 10W weight oil... It's this that has me confused. In my head oils should be like 50w-20 or 75w-30 because the cold oil clearly flows slower than the hot oil. The colder thicker oil flows like a 50 weight when cold and as it warms up it flows better like a 20 weight and so on....this is where my brain is hung up.

It is know to cause lung cancer and death, in addition to the daily “side effects” (yellow teeth, permeating smell, poor lung strength, etc.). 

So why is it still so popular to smoke in Europe? In the U.S., with the increase in knowledge of the bad health effects of smoking, smoking rates decreased heavily. While smoking has decreased some in Europe, it’s still a very popular habit. As far as I know, smoking is allowed and accepted in public quite a bit more in Europe than it is in the U.S. in general.

I found an article from 2006 that mentions that some service providers recycle old phone numbers, but that was 12 years ago. Is there a finite number of available numbers, and do service providers still (unintentionally or otherwise) recycle numbers? Do they have some sort of database that shows current numbers available, and how in the world can they keep up to date with such a constantly changing factor?

\[\[Not to belabor a point, but I remember back in the early 1990s when the area code in my particular suburb was changed twice within a three-year period because of the high demand for telephone numbers - at that time, it was due to fax machines, pagers and ""car phones"" (as we called cell phones at that time).  There were dire predictions at the time that we might have to expand to an 11 or 12-digit system for telephone numbers if that demand continued. Fax machines and pagers aren't as prevalent, but certainly the abundance of cell phones has made up the difference. Yet we still use a 10-digit (not counting the '1' prefix) system.

How is skin even prepared to go on another human being? Does it need to be sterilized since we have a lot of good and bad bacteria that accumulates on the skin? And if so, how is it sterilized without damaging the skin since we depend on moisture in the skin to keep it from being damaged.

I didn't realize until very recently that No Child Left Behind was actually an update of an earlier law called the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)

My understanding of ESEA is very rudimentary - but basically, what I've gathered is that under Title 1 of the law, schools that have a certain percentage of students from low-income families can qualify for funding from the federal government. And I'm aware that No Child Left Behind tied this funding to standardized test scores.

But unless I'm mistaken, all public schools in the country, regardless of whether or not they receive Title 1 funding, administer standardized tests and have been doing so since before the days of No Child Left Behind, right?

So my question is - did No Child Left Behind *only* impact schools that were receiving Title 1 funding? Or did it have some sort of impact on non-title 1 schools as well?

I feel Coulombs Law explains quite intuitively the attractions between ions, molecules with dipoles and even protons and electrons. 

On the most basic level I thought it's just because Hydrogen is missing a valence electron and helium has it's ""s"" pair with which it is happy. But thinking about it, why, there has to be more to it. 

So there is a Proton +1 and an Electron -1 on the Hydrogen and there is two protons +2 and two electrons on the helium -2.
Is the distance from the nucleus much farther for the hydrogen atom?  

Or does it have anything to do with the neutrons? I couldn't think of any way they may effect the ""force"" except that they may shield and act as a permeability factor.

OP's TL;DR
&gt; TL;DR: Asshole in the room beside us kept us up all night with a loud subwoofer. We very nicely asked them to stop, they didn't. So we use RF interference to blow up their subwoofer.

Now I understand this wasn't a Michael Bay movie, but I don't understand what actually did happen, or how.

Edit: Found OP's explanation (not that I understand it that well)

&gt; The distance between my antenna and their subwoofer was maybe 1ft, there was a wall in between but drywall is pretty transparent to radio waves.

&gt; The energy of a radio wave dissapates according to something called the inverse square law; in laymans terms, the energy of the radio wave drops by a magnitude of 4 every time you double your distance from the source. There are more complex things to consider (ie, radiation pattern, propagation characteristics, etc). With their subwoofer so close, it was probably experiencing most of that 400W.

&gt; Radio interference (this was essentially what I was doing) is caused by very strong RF radiation inductively coupling with the subwoofer circuitry (this generates what are called eddy currents) which results in random voltages forming at various points in the circuit which causes it to misbehave. Since I was inputting a ton of RF energy while the circuit was under heavy load (ie. subwoofer thumping), I can only speculate that it generated currents/voltages where they shouldn't be (ie. skewed the bias on the amp) and it blew.",explainlikeimfive,1545144403.0,0100110110010,2,3,0,3

Can anyone explain step by step in the dumbest terms possible how this works?

&amp;#x200B;

Puzzle:

There are two prisoners, and a warden. The warden explains a way for them to go free. He has in his room an 8x8 chessboard, and 64 quarters. He proposes this challenge: He will go into his room, and randomly flip the quarters, either heads or tails, and place each quarter on one of the squares in the chessboard. Then, one of the prisoners will go into the room. The warden will point to one of the squares, which is the magic square. This prisoner then must flip over 1 of the coins on the chessboard, and then he leaves. He can't skew or move any of the coins, just flip 0 or 1. The second prisoner will then come into the room, without ever seeing the board before the change. If he can correctly point out the magic square they will both go free. What is the strategy that the first prisoner should use to make sure they both go free?

I was wondering if that was actually true, since on the 5000th try there's only a 0.367~ chance of the result not having occurred. I thought it might be 3465~ instead, since by the 3465th try there would be an approximately .5 chance of the result already having occurred. However, that .5 chance includes the result having already occurred multiple times, so now I'm stumped. Thanks in advance for the help!



Edit: I definitely might be wrong, but I think my confusion isn't due to the Gambler's fallacy. I know each individual action always has the exact same chance, but the chance of not receiving the 1/x result within Y tries decreases as Y increases. What I mean is there's a lower chance of not having gotten the result after 100 tries than after 10 tries. My question was based on looking at consecutive tries as a whole, not individually. Based on that, if the chance is 1/5000, statistically speaking how many tries would it take the achieve the result for the first time?",explainlikeimfive,1545046748.0,allcatsarebeautiful-,25,18,0,18

t3_a6u8ph,ELI5: Automotive oil weight ratings.,"This has long perplexed me and I will attempt to explain why. 


At 100F a 20 weight will flow better than a 30 weight which will flow better than a 40 weight. So, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. Now the ""W"" weights indicate the viscosity of the oil at 32F (or 0F I forget which temperature) and at 32F a 0W flows better than a 5W which flows better than a 10W. So again, like above, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. I get and understand all this but a 10W-30 flows with a 10weight viscosity at 32F and as it warms up it flows with a 30 weight viscosity. The number goes up, so the oil flows less easily but with the above stated logic and the fact that we all know if I drain 10w30 oil in a car that has sat over night in the winter verses draining it after it just got off the interstate after a 100 mile drive, the hotter and higher 30 weight oil flows better and faster out of the oil pan than the colder thinner 10W weight oil... It's this that has me confused. In my head oils should be like 50w-20 or 75w-30 because the cold oil clearly flows slower than the hot oil. The colder thicker oil flows like a 50 weight when cold and as it warms up it flows better like a 20 weight and so on....this is where my brain is hung up.

It is know to cause lung cancer and death, in addition to the daily “side effects” (yellow teeth, permeating smell, poor lung strength, etc.). 

So why is it still so popular to smoke in Europe? In the U.S., with the increase in knowledge of the bad health effects of smoking, smoking rates decreased heavily. While smoking has decreased some in Europe, it’s still a very popular habit. As far as I know, smoking is allowed and accepted in public quite a bit more in Europe than it is in the U.S. in general.

Is there a finite number of available numbers, and do service providers still (unintentionally or otherwise) recycle numbers?

\[\[Not to belabor a point, but I remember back in the early 1990s when the area code in my particular suburb was changed twice within a three-year period because of the high demand for telephone numbers - at that time, it was due to fax machines, pagers and ""car phones"" (as we called cell phones at that time).  There were dire predictions at the time that we might have to expand to an 11 or 12-digit system for telephone numbers if that demand continued. Fax machines and pagers aren't as prevalent, but certainly the abundance of cell phones has made up the difference. Yet we still use a 10-digit (not counting the '1' prefix) system.

I’m a very curious person with what my friends say is a squirrelly brain (I have ADHD and it is a term of endearment for my quirkiness). Pondering this, my next question was how is skin prepared for transplanting since it seems to be so valuable. I know skin can be transplanted to gums if they have receded or become damage too much, though usually that step is taken from the own person’s body. But that still leaves me pondering.

How is skin even prepared to go on another human being? Does it need to be sterilized since we have a lot of good and bad bacteria that accumulates on the skin? And if so, how is it sterilized without damaging the skin since we depend on moisture in the skin to keep it from being damaged.
