t3_a3pzal,The ultimate Dad Joke - Bulgarian Train Man,"This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.

A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked.

The monk replied ""religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, but why do you need to repair fences?""

t3_9zirmj,Why was 6 afraid of 7?,"6 never did trust 7. Sure, they worked closely together, but 7 always seemed at odds with him. 6 always preferred the company of 4, a perfect 10 of a duo, even though 2 kept them apart.
But when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. Then, 6 found the truth.
6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. When 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling.
Some were considered prime suspects in 9‚Äôs death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. His involvement with 9 added up two well. 
6 snuck into 7‚Äôs house. He looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. An admittedly inappropriate position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9‚Äôs body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9.

I'm going to ask you one question each.""

The saint turns to the first nun and asks: ""Who were the first two humans God created?""

She says: ""Adam and Eve!""

She gets into Heaven.

The saint turns to the second nun and asks: ""What was the one thing Adam and Eve were told not to do in the Garden of Eden?""

She says: ""They weren't allowed to eat the fruit of knowledge!""

She gets into Heaven.

The saint turns to the last nun - the mother superior - and says ""Since you're the mother superior my last question is going to be difficult to answer, but if you answer correctly you can get into Heaven. So my question for you is: What was the first thing Eve said to Adam when they realized they were naked?""

Now she has to think a little and as she thinks she's close to conceding, uttering ""Gee, that's a hard one...""

The saint lets her right into Heaven.

t3_a3sitd,So this might have been posted before but...," A boy was in love with a girl. Madly in love. He told his older brother, who suggested he ask her to the upcoming prom. So, that night, he went to her house with some flowers and chocolates and asked the girl to the prom. 

 She was overjoyed. She took the flowers and hugged him around the neck. When he went home, his brother told him he had to get ready. Prom was in only a week! 

 The next day, he traveled to a suit store. He picked out the perfect one. It would go perfectly with his date‚Äôs dress. He picked his up and went to check out. Unfortunately, it seems a lot of people were buying suits, as the line nearly went out of the store. He groaned, but anything for his love. After two long hours, he finally got his suit. 

 A couple days later, his brother suggested that he rent a limo. He and his brother went to rent one that evening. When they arrived, they discovered that there were nearly 50 people waiting to rent a vehicle. They waited for nearly three hours, but they were finally able to rent a limo for the big day. 

 The afternoon before the dance, he went to buy some flowers for his date. Unfortunately, the store seemed to be having a sale, and the checkout lines extended into the parking lot. He stomped his foot. ‚ÄúWhy is it that every time I go to buy something, everyone else wants to buy it too?!‚Äù He begrudgingly waited for nearly four hour before walking out with a bouquet of roses. 

 That night, he rode in the limo to his date‚Äôs house. She got in, and they talked the entire trip. He presented her with the flowers, which she adored. Her dress was stunning, and went perfectly with his suit. 

 They arrived at the school and got out, arms linked. They walked inside, said hi to a couple of friends, and began dancing and enjoying the night. 

 About halfway through the dance, the boy was parched. He told his girl that he was going to get a drink. He walked over to the snack table and discovered that there was no punch line. ",dadjokes,1544160458.0,ohihatethesepants,8,48,0,48

BUMP...

Walking faster, he looks back and makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street towards him.


BUMP...

BUMP...

BUMP...

Terrified, the man begins running home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him.

FASTER

FASTER

BUMP...

BUMP...

BUMP...

He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, and slams it shut and locks it behind him. 

However, the casket crashes through the door, with the lid of the casket clacking

Clapity-BUMP...

Clapity-BUMP...

Clapity-BUMP...

on his heels, the terrified man runs.

Rushing upstairs in the bathroom, the man locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.

With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door. Bumping and clapping towards him

A man screams and reaches for something, anything, but all he can find is a bottle of cough syrup! Desperate, he throws the bottle of cough syrup at the casket and...

The coffin stops.",dadjokes,1544063445.0,Energylegs23,5,48,0,48

t3_a7cawl,The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver," 

Okay, so this has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A   man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving,  and   runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to  court,   and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row  and  the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The   executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a  banana. The   guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into  the  electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In   Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A   few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new    company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2    people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he    ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from  last   time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The   executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but    whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip    the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second  time.

Some  time passes, and the  executioner is very busy. After another  few  months, the same dude  shows up, apparently having run over 3 people  with  a train.  Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the  third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""",dadjokes,1545177612.0,DylanTheG999,6,34,0,34

Usually this is my Dad. My Mom will be opening presents all day, and Dad is done after he unwraps his three gifts.

We really give him a hard time and he loves it. He's a champ.

Well one year, we're opening gifts, and my brother's got almost nothing in his little pile. He had recently bought a house and his main gift was a garden hose.

This is exciting because we're gonna just tear into him. He is a good sport and he is ready to bask in the glory of his Christmas failure.

We finish the unwrapping and my Dad looks over to him and says ""Well son, you really got hosed this year"".

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked.

The monk replied ""religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, but why do you need to repair fences?""

But when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. Then, 6 found the truth.
6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. When 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling.
Some were considered prime suspects in 9‚Äôs death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. His involvement with 9 added up two well. 
6 snuck into 7‚Äôs house. He looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. An admittedly inappropriate position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9‚Äôs body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9.

It has really torn me up as I am pretty sure he suspects it but is something we have never talked about. We have been really good friends now for 20+ years. I feel even worse because of how much he as looked up to me and how much I have helped him through. At this point there is no way I can break it off with his mother.

Finally I have decided to tell him over dinner and drinks and I invite his mother to come. I was holding her hand under the table the whole meal (since she sat on my side). We finish the food and I finally just come out and say it: John, I have been sleeping with your mother for the past 20+ years, I don't want it to ruin our friendship.

John just looks at me for a solid minute and finally says: Jesus Dad I kind of figured that one out for myself!

t3_a3sitd,So this might have been posted before but...," A boy was in love with a girl. Madly in love. He told his older brother, who suggested he ask her to the upcoming prom. So, that night, he went to her house with some flowers and chocolates and asked the girl to the prom. 

 She was overjoyed. She took the flowers and hugged him around the neck. When he went home, his brother told him he had to get ready. Prom was in only a week! 

 The next day, he traveled to a suit store. He picked out the perfect one. It would go perfectly with his date‚Äôs dress. He picked his up and went to check out. Unfortunately, it seems a lot of people were buying suits, as the line nearly went out of the store. He groaned, but anything for his love. After two long hours, he finally got his suit. 

 A couple days later, his brother suggested that he rent a limo. He and his brother went to rent one that evening. When they arrived, they discovered that there were nearly 50 people waiting to rent a vehicle. They waited for nearly three hours, but they were finally able to rent a limo for the big day. 

 The afternoon before the dance, he went to buy some flowers for his date. Unfortunately, the store seemed to be having a sale, and the checkout lines extended into the parking lot. He stomped his foot. ‚ÄúWhy is it that every time I go to buy something, everyone else wants to buy it too?!‚Äù He begrudgingly waited for nearly four hour before walking out with a bouquet of roses. 

 That night, he rode in the limo to his date‚Äôs house. She got in, and they talked the entire trip. He presented her with the flowers, which she adored. Her dress was stunning, and went perfectly with his suit. 

 They arrived at the school and got out, arms linked. They walked inside, said hi to a couple of friends, and began dancing and enjoying the night. 

 About halfway through the dance, the boy was parched. He told his girl that he was going to get a drink. He walked over to the snack table and discovered that there was no punch line. ",dadjokes,1544160458.0,ohihatethesepants,8,47,0,47

BUMP...

Walking faster, he looks back and makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street towards him.


BUMP...

BUMP...

BUMP...

Terrified, the man begins running home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him.

FASTER

FASTER

BUMP...

BUMP...

BUMP...

He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, and slams it shut and locks it behind him. 

However, the casket crashes through the door, with the lid of the casket clacking

Clapity-BUMP...

Clapity-BUMP...

Clapity-BUMP...

on his heels, the terrified man runs.

Rushing upstairs in the bathroom, the man locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.

With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door. Bumping and clapping towards him

A man screams and reaches for something, anything, but all he can find is a bottle of cough syrup! Desperate, he throws the bottle of cough syrup at the casket and...

The coffin stops.",dadjokes,1544063445.0,Energylegs23,5,49,0,49

t3_a7cawl,The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver," 

Okay, so this has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A   man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving,  and   runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to  court,   and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row  and  the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The   executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a  banana. The   guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into  the  electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In   Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A   few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new    company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2    people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he    ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from  last   time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The   executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but    whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip    the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second  time.

Some  time passes, and the  executioner is very busy. After another  few  months, the same dude  shows up, apparently having run over 3 people  with  a train.  Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the  third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""",dadjokes,1545177612.0,DylanTheG999,6,36,0,36

After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.

Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.

But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.

So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.

t3_a7cawl,The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver," 

Okay, so this has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A   man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving,  and   runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to  court,   and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row  and  the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The   executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a  banana. The   guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into  the  electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In   Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A   few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new    company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2    people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he    ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from  last   time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The   executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but    whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip    the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second  time.

Some  time passes, and the  executioner is very busy. After another  few  months, the same dude  shows up, apparently having run over 3 people  with  a train.  Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the  third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

t3_a6ppw2,PSA regarding the reindeer that lead Santa's sleigh,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen  
But do you know  
Those reindeer are all retired?  
Because it doesn't seem to be a well-known fact, and the portrayals in the media only propagate ignorance regarding the situation.  
**Santa's team only has 2 active members these days**, and none of the aforementioned are a part of it.

Almost everyone can name the first half of the team:  
**Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer**.  He's the star and protagonist of a popular song.
Studies have indicated that, despite being in the song, the other half of the team is all-but-forgotten, Rudolph's *former* tormentor and bully:  
**Olive, the other reindeer**.  *Used to* laugh and call him names.  Of course Olive was downplayed.  It's Christmas, and nobody likes a villain this time of year.  But the two have long ago made amends and have been working together in harmony for decades, and we've all agreed that it's time we moved past these old transgressions, in true Christmas spirit.

#It is our hope for this campaign that people spread the word and give acknowledgements to the long-neglected half of Santa's tireless and dedicated team.  May children across the globe look up at the night sky on Christmas Eve 2018 and admire Olive, who has worked many thankless years in service of the joy of Christmas!

The scientists involved came up with an electronic messaging system that they called the Tickle.

Tickles could be used to send important code updates, meeting invitations, or even just little jokes all along the network.

The DOD heard about these Tickles and asked for a briefing to determine their military potential. At a high-level meeting of generals and admirals, the lead developer presented the Tickle concept.

The ranking General asked for a demonstration and the lead scientist said ""Sure, I'll send you a test Tickle.""

He asks the first man, and he says ""I suspected my wife had been cheating on me, so I came home from work early on purpose to catch her. When I got back to the apartment I found her lying naked in bed like she's just had sex. So I looked under the bed there was no one there, I checked the closet, no one there. I go out and check the balcony and there's some guy hanging from the railing, I was so angry I beat his hands until he fell, I then ran back into the apartment, grabbed the refrigerator and threw it over the balcony and it landed right on top of him. Then I was so mad and angry I had a heart attack and now i'm here""

St.Peter says to him"" Sounds like you had it rough, I'll let you in.

The second man steps up and gets asked the same question

So this man says ""I was in my apartment when I slipped over the railing, I was able to grab onto the railing of the apartment below me, then this guy starts pounding on my fists until I fall. Then he goes and dumps a refrigerator on me and that's how I wound up here""

St.Peter lets this guy in too because he has also had it rough.

The the third guy steps up and is asked the question.

This guy replied ""Okay, so I'm banging this married chick when the husband comes home early. 

So i go and hide in the refrigerator""...

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked.

The monk replied ""religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, but why do you need to repair fences?""

He said: ""Bring me my red shirt!""

The first man who heard the order got him his red shirt. They went to war and killed all the enemy pirates. That night, his crew asked why he wanted a red shirt.

He said: ""If I had been hit during the fight, you wouldn't have seen my blood.""

All his men were looking at him with admiration. The next day, at dawn, 10 ships approched Captain Bravado's vessel. His men were horrified. They were waiting for his order.

t3_a7cawl,The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver," 

Okay, so this has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A   man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving,  and   runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to  court,   and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row  and  the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The   executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a  banana. The   guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into  the  electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In   Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A   few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new    company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2    people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he    ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from  last   time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The   executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but    whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip    the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second  time.

Some  time passes, and the  executioner is very busy. After another  few  months, the same dude  shows up, apparently having run over 3 people  with  a train.  Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the  third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

t3_a6ppw2,PSA regarding the reindeer that lead Santa's sleigh,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen  
But do you know  
Those reindeer are all retired?  
Because it doesn't seem to be a well-known fact, and the portrayals in the media only propagate ignorance regarding the situation.  
**Santa's team only has 2 active members these days**, and none of the aforementioned are a part of it.

Almost everyone can name the first half of the team:  
**Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer**.  He's the star and protagonist of a popular song.
Studies have indicated that, despite being in the song, the other half of the team is all-but-forgotten, Rudolph's *former* tormentor and bully:  
**Olive, the other reindeer**.  *Used to* laugh and call him names.  Of course Olive was downplayed.  It's Christmas, and nobody likes a villain this time of year.  But the two have long ago made amends and have been working together in harmony for decades, and we've all agreed that it's time we moved past these old transgressions, in true Christmas spirit.

#It is our hope for this campaign that people spread the word and give acknowledgements to the long-neglected half of Santa's tireless and dedicated team.  May children across the globe look up at the night sky on Christmas Eve 2018 and admire Olive, who has worked many thankless years in service of the joy of Christmas!
