The ultimate Dad Joke - Bulgarian Train Man,"This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.

A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""

A man needs to hire someone to fix his broken fence.,"So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked.

The monk replied ""religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, but why do you need to repair fences?""

So this might have been posted before but...," A boy was in love with a girl. Madly in love. He told his older brother, who suggested he ask her to the upcoming prom. So, that night, he went to her house with some flowers and chocolates and asked the girl to the prom. 

 She was overjoyed. She took the flowers and hugged him around the neck. When he went home, his brother told him he had to get ready. Prom was in only a week! 

 The next day, he traveled to a suit store. He picked out the perfect one. It would go perfectly with his date’s dress. He picked his up and went to check out. Unfortunately, it seems a lot of people were buying suits, as the line nearly went out of the store. He groaned, but anything for his love. After two long hours, he finally got his suit. 

 A couple days later, his brother suggested that he rent a limo. He and his brother went to rent one that evening. When they arrived, they discovered that there were nearly 50 people waiting to rent a vehicle. They waited for nearly three hours, but they were finally able to rent a limo for the big day. 

 The afternoon before the dance, he went to buy some flowers for his date. Unfortunately, the store seemed to be having a sale, and the checkout lines extended into the parking lot. He stomped his foot. “Why is it that every time I go to buy something, everyone else wants to buy it too?!” He begrudgingly waited for nearly four hour before walking out with a bouquet of roses. 

 That night, he rode in the limo to his date’s house. She got in, and they talked the entire trip. He presented her with the flowers, which she adored. Her dress was stunning, and went perfectly with his suit. 

 They arrived at the school and got out, arms linked. They walked inside, said hi to a couple of friends, and began dancing and enjoying the night.

The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver," 

Okay, so this has been my favorite joke for at least a couple years now.

A   man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving,  and   runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to  court,   and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row  and  the  executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The   executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a  banana. The   guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into  the  electric  chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In   Bulgaria, an act of  divine intervention means you get released.

A   few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new    company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2    people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he    ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from  last   time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The   executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but    whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip    the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second  time.

Some  time passes, and the  executioner is very busy. After another  few  months, the same dude  shows up, apparently having run over 3 people  with  a train.  Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the  third  time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I don't get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didn't let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""",0,"The Ultimate Dad Joke: The Bulgarian Train Driver

"Several years ago, Andy was sentenced to prison. During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates…","


The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.

After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.

Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.

But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.

So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.

But, alas, Andy refused.

PSA regarding the reindeer that lead Santa's sleigh,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen  
But do you know  
Those reindeer are all retired?  
Because it doesn't seem to be a well-known fact, and the portrayals in the media only propagate ignorance regarding the situation.  
**Santa's team only has 2 active members these days**, and none of the aforementioned are a part of it.

Almost everyone can name the first half of the team:  
**Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer**.  He's the star and protagonist of a popular song.
Studies have indicated that, despite being in the song, the other half of the team is all-but-forgotten, Rudolph's *former* tormentor and bully:  
**Olive, the other reindeer**.  *Used to* laugh and call him names.  Of course Olive was downplayed.  It's Christmas, and nobody likes a villain this time of year.  But the two have long ago made amends and have been working together in harmony for decades, and we've all agreed that it's time we moved past these old transgressions, in true Christmas spirit.

#It is our hope for this campaign that people spread the word and give acknowledgements to the long-neglected half of Santa's tireless and dedicated team.  May children across the globe look up at the night sky on Christmas Eve 2018 and admire Olive, who has worked many thankless years in service of the joy of Christmas!

Alternatively I could let it go to, say, 82° (with the thermostat) during the day instead of getting as high as 88° with no daytime cooling. Is it more expensive to keep it 6 degrees cooler during the other 9 hours of the day than it is to try and cool those 6 degrees off plus another 4 degrees for comfort in the house?"

 How were cheques written in the 1940's could you use someone else's cheque?,"There's a scene in MST3K 'I accuse my parents' where a character (Jimmy) isn't able to pay a bill.

 Why was the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War mainly in the South?,"This has been bugging me all morning for reasons unknown, and would really appreciate any insight as to what the answer might be...
So I know that the United States Civil War was not specifically about slavery, but rather, it was about maintaining liberties and the freedom for states to go by their own jurisdiction when it comes to certain laws.  What I’m confused about is this: Why is it that it was mainly just the southern states that left the Union?  What was it about the southern location that gave these states a reason to separate?  I mean, didn’t the North have slaves too?  To put it in other terms, what was the reason that those living more south had differing views as opposed to those living north, if location had anything to do with it at all?

" How are non-organ, donated body parts prepared to be transplanted such as skin?","I was pondering what happens to our bodies when we die. My Great Grandma donated her body to lifesaving medical treatment for others, and I figured it was only organs that were transplanted. Yet I read somewhere in  meme that human skin fetches a high price on the black market and now I wonder why or if it is true.

I’m a very curious person with what my friends say is a squirrelly brain (I have ADHD and it is a term of endearment for my quirkiness). Pondering this, my next question was how is skin prepared for transplanting since it seems to be so valuable. I know skin can be transplanted to gums if they have receded or become damage too much, though usually that step is taken from the own person’s body. But that still leaves me pondering.

How is skin even prepared to go on another human being? Does it need to be sterilized since we have a lot of good and bad bacteria that accumulates on the skin? And if so, how is it sterilized without damaging the skin since we depend on moisture in the skin to keep it from being damaged.

 What effect (if any) did No Child Left Behind have on non-title 1 public schools?,"I'm American, but I don't really know anything about US education policy. And while I'm aware that No Child Left Behind is no longer on the books, I remember hearing people talk about it a lot while I was growing up, so I'm curious to know more about it.

I didn't realize until very recently that No Child Left Behind was actually an update of an earlier law called the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)

My understanding of ESEA is very rudimentary - but basically, what I've gathered is that under Title 1 of the law, schools that have a certain percentage of students from low-income families can qualify for funding from the federal government. And I'm aware that No Child Left Behind tied this funding to standardized test scores.

But unless I'm mistaken, all public schools in the country, regardless of whether or not they receive Title 1 funding, administer standardized tests and have been doing so since before the days of No Child Left Behind, right?

So my question is - did No Child Left Behind *only* impact schools that were receiving Title 1 funding? Or did it have some sort of impact on non-title 1 schools as well?

 How do we know chemical reactions happen the way they do?,"It sounds like a vague title, but hear me out. I am currently taking an organic chemistry class at my university and the thought hit me while we were going over reaction mechanisms: how do we know that this is the mechanism that happens when two things react? Seeing my professor drawing arrows to different parts of the reagents ultimately lead me to this question. I mean, we can't see the reaction in real time as it goes on because it is just way too fast, let alone we hardly have any actual pictures of what an atom looks like, so how are we sure that a specific reaction follows a specific mechanism? For those who don't know, a mechanism is the underlying way of how electrons in your starting material transfer to the different reagents to make your desired product. 

To me, it all seems too convenient that what happens in the matter of picoseconds can be drawn with just a couple of arrows. Am I wrong to think this? How do we know this is actually happening?",1," How do we know chemical reactions happen the way they do? It sounds like a vague title, but hear me out.

How can the Coulomb Force explain why there is diatomic Hydrogen but no diatomic Helium,"So this is a very specific question. I found it on an old practice chemistry test. I find it very interesting and it's been bugging me since early this morning. 

I feel Coulombs Law explains quite intuitively the attractions between ions, molecules with dipoles and even protons and electrons. 

On the most basic level I thought it's just because Hydrogen is missing a valence electron and helium has it's ""s"" pair with which it is happy. But thinking about it, why, there has to be more to it. 

So there is a Proton +1 and an Electron -1 on the Hydrogen and there is two protons +2 and two electrons on the helium -2.
Is the distance from the nucleus much farther for the hydrogen atom?  

Or does it have anything to do with the neutrons? I couldn't think of any way they may effect the ""force"" except that they may shield and act as a permeability factor.

Thank you kind soul who may enlighten me.

: Blowing up a subwoofer with RF interference,"I read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/a45lc7/noisy_neighbors_get_their_subwoofer_blown_up/) the other day on /r/pettyrevenge wherein OP has noisy neighbors and after failing to reason with them, OP using "".... a radio, an 400W amp, antenna, coax cable and a nice beefy power supply ...."" causes their subwoofer to ""blow up"". 

OP's TL;DR
&gt; TL;DR: Asshole in the room beside us kept us up all night with a loud subwoofer. We very nicely asked them to stop, they didn't. So we use RF interference to blow up their subwoofer.

Now I understand this wasn't a Michael Bay movie, but I don't understand what actually did happen, or how.

Edit: Found OP's explanation (not that I understand it that well)

&gt; The distance between my antenna and their subwoofer was maybe 1ft, there was a wall in between but drywall is pretty transparent to radio waves.

&gt; The energy of a radio wave dissapates according to something called the inverse square law; in laymans terms, the energy of the radio wave drops by a magnitude of 4 every time you double your distance from the source. There are more complex things to consider (ie, radiation pattern, propagation characteristics, etc). With their subwoofer so close, it was probably experiencing most of that 400W.

&gt; Radio interference (this was essentially what I was doing) is caused by very strong RF radiation inductively coupling with the subwoofer circuitry (this generates what are called eddy currents) which results in random voltages forming at various points in the circuit which causes it to misbehave. Since I was inputting a ton of RF energy while the circuit was under heavy load (ie. subwoofer thumping), I can only speculate that it generated currents/voltages where they shouldn't be (ie. skewed the bias on the amp) and it blew.",1,": Blowing up a subwoofer with RF interference I read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/a45lc7/noisy_neighbors_get_their_subwoofer_blown_up/) the other day on /r/pettyrevenge wherein OP has noisy neighbors and after failing to reason with them, OP using "".... a radio, an 400W amp, antenna, coax cable and a nice beefy power supply ...."" causes their subwoofer to ""blow up"".

 Automotive oil weight ratings.,"This has long perplexed me and I will attempt to explain why. 


At 100F a 20 weight will flow better than a 30 weight which will flow better than a 40 weight. So, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. Now the ""W"" weights indicate the viscosity of the oil at 32F (or 0F I forget which temperature) and at 32F a 0W flows better than a 5W which flows better than a 10W. So again, like above, the higher the number, the less easily it flows. I get and understand all this but a 10W-30 flows with a 10weight viscosity at 32F and as it warms up it flows with a 30 weight viscosity. The number goes up, so the oil flows less easily but with the above stated logic and the fact that we all know if I drain 10w30 oil in a car that has sat over night in the winter verses draining it after it just got off the interstate after a 100 mile drive, the hotter and higher 30 weight oil flows better and faster out of the oil pan than the colder thinner 10W weight oil... It's this that has me confused. In my head oils should be like 50w-20 or 75w-30 because the cold oil clearly flows slower than the hot oil. The colder thicker oil flows like a 50 weight when cold and as it warms up it flows better like a 20 weight and so on....this is where my brain is hung up. Can someone help explain this.",1," Automotive oil weight ratings. This has long perplexed me and I will attempt to explain why.
